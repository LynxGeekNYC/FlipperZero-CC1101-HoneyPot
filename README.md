CC1101-FZ.PY - For Flipper Zero

# FlipperZero-CC1101-HoneyPot Framework
HoneyPot for FlipperZero CC1101 Sub-1 GHz attacks. Requires a CC1101 Antenna that is connected to a PC/Rasberry Pi, etc. 
Any idiot that connects their FlipperZero to this honeypot will receive insane amount of data with a message that says "Go Fuck Yourself!"
Hopefully freezing the FlipperZero or fill up it's memory. 

This script was specially designed for "geniuses" like 0dayCTF "Ryan Montgomery" who's running around with FlipperZero and call themselves a hacker.
